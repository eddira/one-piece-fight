# One-piece-fight-game made by Mehdi Eddira
<br>

## Why i chose this game?
One piece is the best seller manga of all time with 25 years of existence.
<br>
I remember i started watching it when i was child and i stopped because it's just too long manga!
That's why i had the idea to create this game: Fight between the probably most powerful characters by the approaching end. 
<br>
But also, to put in practice HTML-CSS with JAVASCRIPT DOM manipulation: functions, events, DOM selectors...
<br>

## Key features
* This game is between you and computer. 
* Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) to allow computer to choose your adversary between 9 characters. 
* The first to reach five points wins the game.
* You have about 37% of chance to win, the computer has about 50%. So may the force be with you ! 

## What's next?
Rise the difficulty by increasing the number of possible fighters and rules.
<br>
The saga count more than 400 characters!
